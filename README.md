### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently working on [Selfcustody organization](https://github.com/selfcustody) with the [KruxInstaller](https://github.com/selfcustody/krux-installer).

Almost all my repos are based on spread [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux) firmware
(but can be there some other things related to development for bitcoin).
